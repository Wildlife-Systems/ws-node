# WildlifeSystems - Heartbeat

# This script is used to send a heartbeat to the WildlifeSystems server with
# the current status of the device. This is used to determine if the device is
# online or offline and its operational condition.
#
# This script is part of the WildlifeSystems project. For further information
# please refer to https://docs.wildlife.systems, or for more information on
# the project itself, please refer to https://wildlife.systems.

# If status is not set, set it to empty.
