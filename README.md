# aao-node
This software is used to setup a Raspberry Pi as an Automated Acoustic Observatory node.

## Installing the software
`sudo bash -c "$(wget -O - https://github.com/Wildlife-Systems/aao-node/raw/master/install)"`

The installation script will install the software required to configure a node, and ask the user if they wish to configure the node. 

If the node is not configured during install it can be configured by running `aao-setup` from the terminal.

## Development
* Development of this script was done as part of the Leverhulme Trust funded Automated Acoustic Observatories project at the University of York.
* Additional development was undertaken as part of the Urban Nature Project at the Natural History Museum, London.
